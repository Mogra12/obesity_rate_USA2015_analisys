Overview
The project utilizes visualization libraries like Plotly to create bar charts and pie charts that show the distribution of obesity rates across U.S. regions. These visualizations help identify patterns and provide insights into how obesity varies in different parts of the country.

## Key Features
Calculation and visualization of average obesity rates by region.
Interactive visualizations in bar and pie chart formats to highlight regional differences.
Option to highlight specific regions for better analysis.
Installation
To run this project, you’ll need Python 3 and the specified libraries. Follow the steps below:

## Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/us-obesity-analysis.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd us-obesity-analysis
Install the dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
After installation, you can run the main script to generate the visualizations:

## bash
Copy code
python main.py
Code Example
Below is an example of how the average obesity rates are calculated, and a pie chart is generated with the Plotly library:

## python
Copy code
import plotly.graph_objects as go

# Example of average data
regional_divisions = ["Northeast", "Midwest", "South", "Mountain States", "Pacific Islands"]
mean_values = [
    float(northeast_mean_rate.iloc[0]),  
    float(midwest_mean_rate.iloc[0]),     
    float(south_mean_rate.iloc[0]),      
    float(mountain_mean_rate.iloc[0]),   
    float(pacific_islands_mean_rate.iloc[0])  
]

fig = go.Figure(data=[go.Pie(labels=regional_divisions, values=mean_values, pull=[0, 0, 0, 0.1, 0.1])])
fig.update_layout(title="Obesity Rate Distribution by Region")
fig.show()
## Visualizations
The project includes interactive visualizations to highlight obesity rates across different U.S. regions:

Bar Chart: Compares the average rates between regions.
Pie Chart: Shows the proportion of rates across regions, with optional emphasis on specific slices.
These visualizations allow quick identification of areas with the highest and lowest rates.
